				<b>dHome</b> is the leading manufacturer of dome structures 
				in the world. Our domes are built to exacting standards using 
				the highest quality materials. We've been building domes for over
				35 years and have a proven track record of providing quality 
				homes at reasonable prices.
			</p>

			<p>
				A dome house provides you with a totally new living experience 
				in a spacious and open environment. Imagine a curved ceiling more 
				than 20 feet high with skylights bringing the beauty of the outdoors 
				into your home.
			</p>

			<p>Domes are stronger and safer than conventional homes, and their 
				design provides more stability against hurricanes, tornados, and 
				earthquakes. Dome houses are also more energy efficient. A dome home 
				has approximately 30 to 50% less roof and wall area exposed to the 
				elements than conventional homes, resulting in reduced energy costs.
				The spherical space also provides for a natural air flow, minimizing 
				cold spots and increasing interior comfort.
